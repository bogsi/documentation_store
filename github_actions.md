What Is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions provides automation directly within GitHub repositories. It lets users create workflows that respond to events like code commits, pull requests, merges, or custom triggers. Every workflow is defined in a YAML file under `.github/workflows`.
Key Components
	•	Workflow: The main automation blueprint, stored as a YAML file in `.github/workflows`, which consists of one or more jobs.
	•	Event: A specific trigger (e.g., push, pull request) that starts the workflow.
	•	Job: A set of steps executed in sequence or parallel, possibly running on different environments.
	•	Step: Individual tasks, such as running commands or using predefined actions. Steps run in order and can use third-party actions.
Getting Started
Creating Your First Workflow
	1.	Go to the GitHub repository.
	2.	Click the Actions tab.
	3.	Select a suggested or blank workflow and click Configure.
	4.	Edit the workflow YAML file and commit the changes.
	5.	Monitor the Actions tab for workflow execution and results.

    '''yaml
    name: Demo Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy

    Workflow Syntax and Structure
Workflows use YAML syntax. Key elements:
	•	`name`: Workflow name.
	•	`on`: Workflow trigger (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.).
	•	`jobs`: Parallel (or sequential) scriptable jobs to execute.
	•	Each job uses a `runs-on` runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`).
	•	Job `steps`: Use built-in actions or custom scripts.

Best Practices
    •	Use reusable workflows for common tasks.
    •	Keep workflows concise and focused on a single task.
    •	Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys).
    •	Regularly review and update workflows for efficiency.
